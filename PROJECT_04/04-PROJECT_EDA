  Import Listings (id, neighbourhood_cleansed, bedrooms, etc.) and Calendar (listing_id, date, available, price).

2. Prep & Measures
  Clean price (remove $).
  Add column: Booked Revenue = IF(available = "f", price, 0).
  Key measures:
  Total Listings = DISTINCTCOUNT(Listings[id])Total Revenue = SUM(Calendar[Booked Revenue])Avg Daily Rate = AVERAGE(Calendar[price])Occupancy = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(Calendar, available="f")), COUNTROWS(Calendar))

3. Visuals
  Cards: Total Listings (7341), Total Revenue, Avg Daily Rate, Occupancy.
  Horizontal bar: Count of id by neighbourhood_cleansed (top 10–15, descending).
  Clustered column: Count of id by bedrooms.
  Filled map: neighbourhood_cleansed with Total Revenue or count on color.
  Slicers: bedrooms (multi), room_type.

4. Layout & Polish
  Dark page background, light cards.
  Title at top (e.g., “Airbnb Market Overview”).
  Enable cross-filtering and slicer sync.
  Custom tooltips, consistent colors.
