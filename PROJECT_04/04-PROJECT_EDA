Steps taken to create Tableau visual project

1. Connect Data
Load Listings (id, neighbourhood, bedrooms, room_type, price, etc.) and Calendar (listing_id, date, available, price) datasets.
2. Prep & Calculations
Clean price fields (remove $ symbols).
Create key fields: Booked Revenue = IF([available] = "f", [price], 0); Total Listings = COUNTD([id]); Average Price; Occupancy Rate; Total Revenue.
3. Build Visuals
KPI Cards: Total Listings, Average Price, Occupancy Rate, Total/Estimated Revenue.
Bar/Column Charts: Count or revenue by neighbourhood (top N, sorted); distribution by bedrooms.
Filled Map: Neighbourhoods colored/sized by revenue, count, or price.
Filters: Room type, bedrooms (multi-select).
4. Dashboard Layout
Add dashboard title (e.g., "Airbnb Market Overview").
Top row: KPI cards.
Main area: Map on one side, bar charts on the other.
Apply filters globally and add actions for cross-filtering/highlighting.
5. Polish & Publish
Apply consistent color palette, custom tooltips, currency/date formatting.
Test interactivity.
Publish to Tableau Public.
