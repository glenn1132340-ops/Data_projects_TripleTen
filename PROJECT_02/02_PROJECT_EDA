Shopify App Analysis

Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior and conversion metrics for a e-commerce website using Excel. The goal was to help the executive team understand how well the site converts visitors into buyers and how well it retains customers over time.

Key Analyses Performed
1. Conversion Funnel
   • Built a 3-stage funnel (Product View → Add to Cart → Purchase) using unique user counts from raw activity data
   • Calculated overall conversion rate and step-to-step drop-off rates

2. Cohort Retention Analysis
   • Isolated 4,845 purchase events from mixed activity data
   • Calculated each user's first purchase month to form acquisition cohorts (6 cohorts total)
   • Tracked monthly retention by calculating cohort age (0-4 months)
   • Computed retention rates for months 1-4 after first purchase

Skills Demonstrated
• Advanced Excel techniques: Pivot tables, filters, VLOOKUP, TEXT(), DATEDIF()
• Data cleaning and preparation for cohort analysis
• Building clear, executive-ready summaries with proper formatting and documentation

Key Insights (from the analysis)
• Significant drop-off between product views and adding to cart
• Highest retention in the first cohort, with gradual decline in later cohorts
• Opportunities to improve early funnel stages and re-engagement strategies

Tools Used
Excel (pivot tables, advanced formulas, dashboard-like sheets)
